# Case Study - Hypothesis Testing

## Where stuff is 
* `notebooks/student.ipynb` -> notebook where work goes
* `data/northWind.sqlite` -> dataset you'll be using
* `images/` -> put any images you use here
* `notebooks/` -> if you make extra notebooks, put them here

## Deliverables
* Notebooks(s) with questions answered
    * hypothesis tests conducted correctly
    * test for normality
* Three code snippets to share with others
    * Did you write a cool function? 
    * Did you create a .py File
    * Did you make a class that will take in data and test it?
    * Did you make a function for visualizations?
* Custom README.md
    * Show Intro
    * Show Questions
* No Presentation (Unless you want to make one)

## Instructions
You are a DS working for Northwind, a supplier company.  Your job is find interesting relationships in their database.  They have tasked you with two questions. You'll find these in the notebooks. You are then tasked to dig into the data in a way that you find interesting.


* Answer the following questions using sampling distributions
* For each question
    * Setup a hypothesis test writing H0 and HA
    * Conduct test with a alpha of 0.05
    * Show distributions in a visualization
        * Use a legend to label distributions
    * Write a conclusion
    * If there is a difference in means
        * Use Cohen's D to measure the effect size
        * Conduct a Power Analysis
* Remember if you have multiple groups use ANOVA and Tukey Testing
* Work should be done in the `student.ipynb` file found in the `notebooks/` directory
* Create a custom README.md for your repo
